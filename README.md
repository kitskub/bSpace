Coding and Pull Request Conventions
-----------

* We generally follow the Sun/Oracle coding standards.
* No tabs; use 4 spaces instead.
* No trailing whitespaces.
* No 80 column limit or midstatement newlines (usually).
* No fucking ugly Eclipse formatting (unless you have modified it to actually look good).
* Proper javadoc for each method added/changed to describe what it does.
* The number of commits in a pull request should be kept to a minimum (squish them into one most of the time - use common sense!).
* No merges should be included in pull requests unless the pull request's purpose is a merge.
* Pull requests should be tested (does it compile? AND does it work?) before submission.

Follow the above conventions if you want your pull requests accepted.
